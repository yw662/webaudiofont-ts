# webaudiofont-ts
a typescript fork for [webaudiofont](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont).

Due to a license issue, as you may have noticed, this project (which is under MIT license) is not willing to catch up further with upstream (which is previously MIT but now GPL).
If you want a newer version, you may need to do it on your own, or maybe we can talk about that.
